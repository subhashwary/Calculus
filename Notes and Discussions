Chapters

Calculus is divided into two primary, interconnected branches: 

1. Differential Calculus: Focuses on the concept of the derivative, which measures the instantaneous rate of change and the slope of a curve at a specific point.
2. Integral Calculus: Focuses on the concept of the integral, which measures the accumulation of quantities, such as the area under a curve or the total volume of an object.

Foundational Concepts

Key mathematical tools are used: 
1. Limits: The method used to describe the behavior of a function as it approaches a certain value.
2. Functions: Mathematical relationships that map inputs to outputs, serving as the basis for differentiation and integration.
3. Continuity: The property of a function where there are no sudden jumps or breaks in its graph. 

Calculus was independently developed in the late 17th century by two mathematicians: 
1. Isaac Newton: An English physicist and mathematician who used calculus to describe the laws of motion and gravitation.
2. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz: A German mathematician who developed much of the notation (such as \(dx\) and \(dy\)) still used today.
