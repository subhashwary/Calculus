Chapters

Calculus is divided into two primary, interconnected branches: 

1. Differential Calculus: Focuses on the concept of the derivative, which measures the instantaneous rate of change and the slope of a curve at a specific point.
2. Integral Calculus: Focuses on the concept of the integral, which measures the accumulation of quantities, such as the area under a curve or the total volume of an object.
