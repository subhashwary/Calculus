Chapters

Calculus is divided into two primary, interconnected branches: 

1. Differential Calculus: Focuses on the concept of the derivative, which measures the instantaneous rate of change and the slope of a curve at a specific point.
2. Integral Calculus: Focuses on the concept of the integral, which measures the accumulation of quantities, such as the area under a curve or the total volume of an object.

Foundational Concepts

Key mathematical tools are used: 
1. Limits: The method used to describe the behavior of a function as it approaches a certain value.
2. Functions: Mathematical relationships that map inputs to outputs, serving as the basis for differentiation and integration.
3. Continuity: The property of a function where there are no sudden jumps or breaks in its graph. 

Calculus was independently developed in the late 17th century by two mathematicians: 
1. Isaac Newton: An English physicist and mathematician who used calculus to describe the laws of motion and gravitation.
2. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz: A German mathematician who developed much of the notation (such as \(dx\) and \(dy\)) still used today.

Calculus is an essential tool across various fields: 
1. Physics & Engineering: Modeling motion, acceleration, and the structural integrity of bridges and buildings.
2. Economics: Determining marginal costs, marginal revenue, and predicting market trends.
3. Biology & Medicine: Modeling population growth, the spread of infectious diseases, and the flow of blood through arteries.
4. Computer Science: Designing algorithms, processing images, and developing artificial intelligence. 

Calculus is the mathematical study of continuous change, originally developed independently by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the late 17th century. 
It serves as a foundational tool for modeling systems where quantities vary over time or another reference value.
