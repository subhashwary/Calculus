Preparation tips to secure full marks Calculus exam.

1. Master the Basics
Start by understanding the fundamental concepts of Calculus, like limits, derivatives, and integrals. These basics are crucial for solving more complex problems.

2. Practice Differentiation
Get comfortable with finding the derivative of various functions. Practice problems involving rules of differentiation (like the chain rule, product rule, and quotient rule).

3. Learn Integration Techniques
Study different methods of integration, such as substitution, partial fractions, and integration by parts. Practice solving integrals of various types.

4. Use NCERT Books
Focus on the Calculus chapters in your NCERT textbooks for Class 11 and 12. These books cover the syllabus comprehensively and are a good starting point.

5. Solve Previous Years' Papers
Work through past JEE Main exam papers to understand the types of Calculus questions asked and get a feel for the exam pattern.

6. Work on Practice Problems
Practice a wide range of Calculus problems regularly. The more problems you solve, the better you'll get at applying the concepts.

7. Review and Revise
